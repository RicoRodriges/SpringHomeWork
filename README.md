# Spring Task 2
Implement horse race emulator

**Move configuration from XML to Java based and annotation-based approach**

Required beans:

* HorseService for horse management (horses with their riders, breeds and other characteristics should be obtained from the configuration)
* RaceService for simple getRace() method which generates and returns information about the upcoming race (horses can be choosen randomly)
* EmulationService for real-time race emulation (it generates data about horses positions on the console for every second)

Main domain objects: Horse, Race, Rider, Breed.

Add client code:

* On start-up application shows the information about upcoming race.
* User is offered to choose his horse (make a bet) with searching by name, breed, riderâ€™s name
* After that a race emulation starts
* Winner announcement is displayed

(Nothing super-fancy in UI, just console application)
